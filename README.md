# headlessChrome ğŸ¤–
**MacOS and Docker'd Ubuntu only for now.**  ğŸ˜¬

A [go](https://golang.org) package for working with headless Chrome.  Run interactive JavaScript commands on pages with go and Chrome without a GUI.  Includes a few helpful functions out of the box to query and click selector paths by their classes or content (innerHTML).

You could use this package to click buttons and scrape content on/from a website as if you were a browser, or to render pages that wouldn't be supported by other things like phantomjs or casperjs.  Especially useful for sites that use EmberJS, where the content is rendered by javascript after the HTML payload is delivered.

#### Install
`go get github.com/integrii/headlessChrome`

#### Documentation
[http://godoc.org/github.com/integrii/headlessChrome](http://godoc.org/github.com/integrii/headlessChrome)

##### Docker Version
To run Chrome headless with docker, check out `examples/docker/main.go` as well as `examples/docker/Makefile`.  When in that directory, you can do `make build` to build the container with the example app inside.

##### Custom Flags
By default, we startup with the bare minimum flags necessary to start headless chrome and open a javascript console.  If you want more flags, like a resolution size, or a custom User-Agent, you can specify it by replacing the `Args` variable.  Just be sure to append to it so you don't kill the default flags...

```go
headlessChrome.Args = append(headlessChrome.Args,"--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36")
headlessChrome.Args = append(headlessChrome.Args,"--window-size=1024,768")
```

##### Changing the Path to Chrome

Change the path to Chrome by simply setting the `headlessChrome.ChromePath` variable.  
```go
headlessChrome.ChromePath = `/opt/google/chrome-unstable/chrome`
```


#### Mac Example

```go
// make a new session
browser, err := headlessChrome.NewBrowser(`google.com`)
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
// End the session by writing quit to the console
defer browser.Exit()

// sleep while content is rendered.  You could replace this
// with some javascript that only returns when the
// content exists to be safer.
time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)

// Query all the HTML from the web site
browser.Write(`document.documentElement.outerHTML`)

// loop over all the output that came from the output channel
// and print it to the console
for len(browser.Output) > 0 {
  fmt.Println(<-browser.Output)
}

// click some span element from the page by its text content
browser.ClickItemWithInnerHTML("span", "Google Search",0)

// select the content of something by its css classes
browser.GetContentOfItemWithClasses("button arrow bold",0)
time.Sleep(time.Second) // give it a second to query

// read the selected stuff from the console by picking
// the next item from the output channel
fmt.Println(<-browser.Output)

```


#### Contributing

Please send pull requests!  It would be good to have support for more operating systems or more handy helpers to run more commonly used javascript code easily.  Adding support for other operating systems should be as simple as checking the platform type and changing the `ChromePath` variable's default value.
